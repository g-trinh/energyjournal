# Synopsis

This project is about tracking the user’s energy levels.

There are 3 types of energy :

1. Physical : is the user physically able to accomplish their tasks ? Are they physically tired ?
2. Mental : is the user mentally capable to focus on their tasks?
3. Emotional : is the user willing to engage in their tasks?

Everyday and for each type of energy, the user will give a grade from 0 to 10, 0 being the lowest level and 10 the highest.

The app shows :

- how the energy levels vary
- a list of marking events every day and which type of energy and how it has been affected
- a summary of how the user spent their time week after week
